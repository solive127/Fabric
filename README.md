<h1>Microsoft Fabric Project</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

*Built an end-to-end data analytics solution using Microsoft Fabric to model and visualize healthcare data, focusing on patient encounters, diagnoses, and provider performance.

Designed and implemented a star schema with a central fact table (patient visits) and multiple dimension tables (patients, providers, dates, diagnoses) to enable efficient slicing and high-performance querying.

Utilized Dataflows Gen2 and Lakehouse architecture in Microsoft Fabric to ingest, clean, and transform large volumes of structured clinical data.

Created semantic models using Power BI integrated into Fabric, with DAX measures for KPIs such as average length of stay, readmission rates, and diagnosis trends.

Enabled stakeholders to drill down by provider, facility, diagnosis category, and time period, supporting data-driven decisions in care quality improvement.
